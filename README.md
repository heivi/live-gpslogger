# Live GpsLogger

Suited for outdoor gps tracking, with html5 tracking app.

Cordova app included, with at least android platform somewhat working.

Backend is simple php-script with gpsseuranta.net -formatted output.

No buffering of transfer, but right away when available.

Somewhat based on [http://routegadget.net/gps/logger.html](http://routegadget.net/gps/logger.html).
